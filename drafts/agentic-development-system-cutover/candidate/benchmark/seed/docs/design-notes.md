# Design notes

Human-facing design notes are recorded in this directory, one note per design decision, newest last. Format: request summary, decision, options considered, and the bounded change the decision authorizes.

## Existing note: count command output (initial seed)

- Request: report word frequencies for a text file.
- Decision: `wordstats count <path>` prints a JSON object mapping lowercased words to counts, keys sorted alphabetically, 2-space indent.
- Options considered: plain text columns (rejected: harder to consume programmatically); CSV (rejected: quoting complexity for a tiny utility).
- Bounded change authorized: the initial `count` command only.
